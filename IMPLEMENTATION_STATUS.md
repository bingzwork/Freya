# High Priority Work

The following work provides the highest impact because the implementation already exists but is not fully integrated.

- ~~Integrate Experience Memory into the runtime~~ — completed in Priority 1 + Priority 4 (ExperienceMemory is exported from `app/memory/__init__.py`, owned by `FreyaAgent`, written from `solve()` / `repair()`, and read into `run()`).
- ~~Integrate Engineering Lessons into planning and repair~~ — completed in Priority 1 + Priority 2 + Priority 3 + Priority 4 (EngineeringLessonStorage is exported, owned by `FreyaAgent`, written from `solve()` / `repair()`, and read by `Planner.create_plan()`, `FreyaAgent.repair()`, `FreyaAgent.run()`, and `Executor._select_tool_with_llm`).
- ~~Migrate from the legacy planner to the new planner framework (Phase 1)~~ — completed (PlanManager integrated into FreyaAgent; Planner creates Plan objects; Executor consumes Plan objects; backward compatibility maintained).
- ~~Migrate from the legacy planner to the new planner framework (Phase 2+)~~ — **Phase 2 complete:** `Planner.create_plan()` builds TaskGraph with sequential dependencies, `TaskGraph.topological_sort()` drives `Executor.execute_plan()` execution order, cycle detection rejects cyclic graphs, completed TaskNode state preserved for replanning. **Phase 3 complete:** Scheduler (ASAP, PRIORITY_FIRST) and ResourceAllocator (default MACHINE, TOOL, GPU resources) wired into execution pipeline; linear loop replaced with scheduler-driven execution.
- Connect monitoring, diagnostics, confidence, and risk into a unified runtime decision pipeline.
- Build the closed-loop self-improvement pipeline.
- Add external knowledge acquisition.
- Add additional LLM providers.

### Decision Making

Status: ✅ COMPLETE (85%)

**Phase 1 — Decision Management Foundation: COMPLETE ✅**

Core unified decision framework implemented in `app/decision/`:

**Implemented Components:**
- **Decision Manager** (`app/decision/manager.py`) — Central orchestrator running Observe→Gather→Identify→Evaluate→Estimate Risk/Benefit→Choose→Execute→Observe loop
- **Decision Workflow** (`app/decision/workflow.py`) — Structured 6-step pipeline: OBSERVE, GATHER_CONTEXT, IDENTIFY_ACTIONS, EVALUATE_OPTIONS, ESTIMATE_RISK_BENEFIT, CHOOSE_BEST
- **Decision History** (`app/decision/history.py`) — Persistent JSON log with searchable records (by type, category, component, outcome, time range)
- **Decision Models** (`app/decision/models.py`) — DecisionCategory (5), DecisionType (20), DecisionContext, DecisionOption, DecisionResult, DecisionRecord
- **Category-Specific Handlers** — Execution, Information, Planning, Recovery, Learning with tailored logic
- **Convenience Functions** — `decide_context_sufficiency()`, `decide_tool_selection()`, `decide_recovery_action()`, `decide_plan_approach()`, `decide_replanning_strategy()`, `decide_planning_strategy()`
- **Explainable Decisions** — `DecisionResult.explain()` and `DecisionManager.explain_decision()` in plain English
- **Human Oversight Gates** — Automatic approval requirements based on risk level and confidence thresholds

**Integration Points in FreyaAgent (`app/agent/core_agent.py`):**
1. **Context Sufficiency** — Replaced `_has_sufficient_context()` with `decide_context_sufficiency()`
2. **Tool Selection** — Replaced implicit selection with `decide_tool_selection()`
3. **Recovery Actions** — Replaced ad-hoc retry logic with `decide_recovery_action()`
4. **Replanning Strategy** — Replaced replanning logic with `decide_replanning_strategy()`
5. **Planning Strategy** — Added `decide_planning_strategy()` for initial plan creation

**Tests:** 20 passing tests in `tests/test_decision_management.py` covering models, history, workflow, manager, convenience functions, and category handlers.

**Phases (from DECISION_MAKING.md):**
| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 — Decision Framework | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 — Context & Information Decisions | ✅ Complete (integrated) |
| Phase 3 — Risk & Confidence Evaluation | ✅ Complete (integrated) |
| Phase 4 — Execution Decisions | ✅ Complete (integrated) |
| Phase 5 — Adaptive Decision Making | ✅ Complete (integrated) |
| Phase 6 — Decision History | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 7 — Learning From Decisions | 🟡 Partial (lessons/experience exist, decision-level learning pending) |
| Phase 8 — Autonomous Judgment System | ⚪ Not Started (Phase 2+) |

**Future Enhancements (Phase 2+):**
1. **Adaptive Decision Revision** — Monitor and re-evaluate decisions during execution
2. **Learning From Decisions** — Analyze outcomes, calibrate confidence models
3. **Human Oversight Enhancement** — Interactive approval UI integration
4. **Decision Visualization** — Tree/graph export, timeline views
5. **Meta-Decision Learning** — Learn when to trust/subvert own estimates

### Software Engineering Knowledge

Status: 🟢 IMPLEMENTED (Knowledge Domain)

Software Engineering Knowledge is implemented as a core knowledge domain within the Knowledge Base.

Current capabilities include:

- Storage of reusable engineering knowledge
- Project-specific engineering knowledge
- Engineering lesson retrieval
- Semantic search integration
- Context retrieval integration
- Code indexing integration

Future enhancements include:

- External engineering knowledge acquisition
- Internet research
- Knowledge validation
- Knowledge consolidation

# Document Update Rules

Whenever a capability changes:

- Update the capability status.
- Update the completion percentage.
- Update the Last Updated date.
- Mark completed checklist items.
- Add new bugs or technical debt if discovered.
- Remove resolved issues.

This document should evolve with the implementation and replace separate audit reports, implementation reports, and scattered TODO documents.
